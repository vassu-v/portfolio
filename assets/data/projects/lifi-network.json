    "description": "Problem: Power grids and mobile networks fail simultaneously during natural disasters. Communities lose contact with rescue teams when they need it most. Solution: Retrofit solar street lamps with IR transceivers to create a disaster-resilient mesh network. Each lamp forwards emergency messages hop-by-hop using light, operates entirely off-grid, and routes SOS alerts to headquarters using gradient-based routing.",
