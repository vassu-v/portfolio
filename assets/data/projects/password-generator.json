    "description": "This password generator is a lightweight web tool that allows users to create secure, customizable passwords. It offers options to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and lets users define the desired length for maximum flexibility. Fully client-side, it ensures user privacy and promotes stronger password habits. While primarily designed for password generation, it can also be repurposed creatively to generate secure PINs, temporary access codes, or randomized OTPs for apps and websites. Its success is measured by ease of use, correctness of output, and cross-device responsiveness, making it a practical and adaptable solution.",
